## Installation

npm install @bentoo/state-man
```

or via Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @bentoo/state-man
```

or via pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @bentoo/state-man
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use `@bentoo/state-man` in your project:

### 1. create a store
```tsx
// ./stores/counter.ts
import { create } from '@bentoo/state-man'

export const useStore = create(0)

```
### 2. use your store anywhere
```tsx
// counter.tsx
export const Counter = () => {
  const {state,setState} = useStore()

  const increment = () => setState(state + 1);

  return (
    <button onClick={increment}>
      Count is {state}
    </button>
  );
}

// App.tsx
import Counter from './counter'
import { useStore } from './stores/counter'

function App() {
  const {state} = useStore()

  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h1>Now the counter is: {state}</h1>
      <Counter/>
    </div>
  )
}
co
export default App
```
### Persisting Store Data
You can persist your store's data across sessions by saving it to a storage medium such as localStorage, sessionStorage, or other available storage options. This ensures that the data is retained even when the page is reloaded or the browser is closed and reopened.

```jsx
import { create, persist } from '@bentoo/state-man'

const useUserStore = create(
  persist({
    name: 'userStoreKey',
    data: { name: 'Bentoooo' },
    storage: sessionStorage 
  })
)
```

| `name`     | `string`  | Unique name of the store, used as a key to store and retrieve data from storage.                        |
